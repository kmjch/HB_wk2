Part 1: Discussion

1. What are the three main design advantages that object orientation
   can provide? Explain each concept.

Having classes makes possible:
subclasses that inherit attributes and methods from their parent. This allows us
to make variations of the parent rather easily.
Keeps the code from being overly long, confusing, or repetitive.
-abstraction:
 don't need to let the user know all the intricacies of how certain functions work
-encapsulation:
 data is bundled with the functions that work on that data
-polymorphism:
 functions or methods can be applied to more than one subclass â€” general enough


2. What is a class?
It's a "type" of object that a coder can create, and it usually has a template
of attributes and that its subclasses can take on

3. What is an instance attribute?


4. What is a method?

5. What is an instance in object orientation?
It's when 

6. How is a class attribute different than an instance attribute?
   Give an example of when you might use each.
